# INTRODUCTION TO THE SERVER [ FORGE ] V2

Transition from RealmMontana:

The idea for The Forge was sparked within the RealmMontana community, where there was a desire to shift away from the toxic environment and create a more supportive and specialized space.
Recognizing the potential for a dedicated server, the decision was made to establish The Forge.

Collaborations: Partnerships with other communities and developers were pursued to bring new perspectives and innovations to The Forge.
Future Plans: The server continues to evolve with the aim of expanding features, enhancing user experience, and supporting the growth of the community.
